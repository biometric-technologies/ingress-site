### Introduction 

Financial inclusion is a hot topic in the world of development and humanitarian aid. And for good reason: according to
the World Bank, 1.7 billion adults worldwide are still unbanked. That means they don't have access to basic financial
services like savings accounts, loans, and insurance. For vulnerable populations like refugees, this lack of access can
be especially detrimental.
That's where microlending comes in. Microlending is the practice of providing small loans to individuals who might not
otherwise qualify for traditional banking products. It's a way to increase financial inclusion for those who need it
most. And biometrics can play a role in making microlending more secure.

#### What are Biometrics?

Biometrics refers to the use of physical or behavioral characteristics to verify someone's identity. Unlike other forms
of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, biometrics cannot be lost, stolen, or shared without the
individual's knowledge or consent. As such, they are an ideal way to verify the identity of someone who is seeking a
loan.
There are a number of different types of biometrics that can be used for this purpose, including fingerprints, iris
scans, and facial recognition. In most cases, multiple biometrics will be used in conjunction with one another to verify
someone's identity. For example, a borrower seeking a loan might be asked to provide their fingerprint and iris scan.
The use of biometrics has been shown to effectively combat fraud in microlending. In one study, the use of biometrics
was found to reduce fraud by up to 90%. This is due to the fact that it is very difficult to forge someone's biometric
information. As such, the use of biometrics can help ensure that loans are only given to those who are truly eligible
for them.

#### How Can Biometrics Help Fight Fraud in Microlending?

Fraud is always a concern in any lending situation. But it's especially a concern in microlending, where loans are often
given out without collateral or co-signers. That's why many microlenders are turning to biometrics to help prevent fraud
and protect their borrowers' information.
There are a few different ways that biometrics can be used to fight fraud in microlending:

- Identity verification: This is perhaps the most obvious way that biometrics can be used in microlending. By verifying
  the identity of loan applicants using biometric data, lenders can be sure that they're actually dealing with the
  person they think they are. This helps prevent cases of identity theft and other types of fraud.
- Authorization: Another way that biometrics can be used in microlending is for authorization purposes. Borrowers could
  use their biometric data (e.g., a fingerprint) to authorize loan payments from their mobile devices. This would help
  prevent unauthorized payments and fraudulent activity related to loans.
  Digital credit histories
  Digital credit histories are a relatively new concept, but they are already having a major impact on financial
  inclusion in developing countries. A digital credit history is simply a record of an individual's borrowing and
  repayment history that is stored on a secure, online platform. These records can be accessed by lenders when
  considering loan applications, which makes it easier for them to assess an applicant's creditworthiness.
  Digital credit histories have the potential to transform financial inclusion in developing countries by making it
  easier for lenders to assess an applicant's creditworthiness. By giving lenders visibility into an individual's
  repayment history, digital credit histories make it possible for more people to access formal financial services. And
  when more people have access to financial services, it can help reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth.
  There are many reasons why financial inclusion is important, but it's especially important for vulnerable populations
  like refugees. That's where microlending and digital credit histories come in to help people access the capital they
  need to start or grow their businesses. Using biometrics for things like identity verification, authorization in
  combination with identification of risky behaviour and transaction monitoring, lending organizations can help prevent
  fraud while also increasing financial inclusion for those who need it most. When used correctly, these tools can help
  reduce poverty and create economic opportunities for those who would otherwise be excluded from the formal financial
  system.
