INGRESS provides access to cryptographically secured credit history for microlending in crypto and fiat currencies. We
address trust and security issues of digital economy using combination of biometric identification with asymmetric
cryptography. This enables individuals possessing the private keys of re-issuing the credentials they own in unfortunate
case of private key loss or compromise. INGRESS wallet connects the users to the marketplace of loans, provided by the
lenders. Lenders compete among each other to win the users, which results in affordable credit for users with good
credit histories.

The use of Biometrics as a mean of identifying user identity ensures security but also expands the number of possible
applications to parts of the world where underdeveloped regulatory systems make lending too high risk for large amounts
of capital to the issued to economically disadvantaged and at risk persons. This presents new opportunities for finding
ways to improve global living standards by providing microlending facilities to people who are excluded from the
traditional economic system.

The INGRESS core technology has other applications in healthcare, education, and humanitarian work. As with microlending
fraud against healthcare, education, and humanitarian service providers most acutely affects the most at risk people in
the global south. INGRESS is proud to be working on a core technology that can enable people and organizations working
in these and other areas to secure their services and provide accountability to their financing bodies.
